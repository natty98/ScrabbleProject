## Scrabble Project
I am starting this project simply because of my recent fascination with scrabble. I plan to start off with creating a scrabble word finder and then making a scrabble game for 2 to 4 players.

## Scrabble Word Finder 
How it works:
1. Letter available on board is inputed that the user wants to play with (e.g F)
2. Add to the letters available to the player(e.g I,R,D,S,T,A,Y)
3. Check the words in the scrabble dictionary that have those letters (and the max no. of letters if available)
4. List them out for the player to see(e.g FIR, FIRST, FAD,FITS, FIT etc.)(modification for the addition of scores as well)
5. Player then chooses which words to use from the ptions that they want to use. THE END.

What is needed:
- Values for each letter
